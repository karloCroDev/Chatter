Chatter is a user-friendly chat application that enables users to send messages directly to each other in real-time. Built with React and Firebase, this app provides a seamless messaging experience with instant updates, secure authentication.

Note: I didn't make this website mobile responsive, however it should work fine on desktop

**Tech stack**

 - List item
 - [React](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is known for its component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable UI components. It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components, making it ideal for building dynamic and interactive web applications. React's declarative nature makes the code more predictable and easier to debug. It is widely supported by a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, enhancing its functionality and developer productivity.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A fast and modern build tool for web applications. Vite provides an extremely fast development experience by leveraging native ES modules and modern JavaScript features. It offers instant server start, lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized builds. Vite is highly configurable and supports TypeScript, JSX, and CSS pre-processors out of the box. Its performance and simplicity make it an excellent choice for modern web development.
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) - Cascading Style Sheets are used for styling the application. CSS allows for the separation of content and presentation, making it easier to maintain and scale the application's design. The app uses modern CSS features and methodologies, such as Flexbox and Grid, to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
